# GifTastic

## What's this project about?
This project was designed to learn about the functionality and benefits of APIs. APIs are a tremendously powerful building blocks that both facilitate the ease of design for the developer and also make for a more enriching and dynamic experience for the user. 

 _**Emotions**_ was the theme I chose for this assignment as one tends to go through a roller coaster of emotions while learning code!
 
  * :sunglasses: Click any button to access 10 gifs. 
  * :relaxed: Search new emotions by adding a button. 
  * :weary: _HINT: Trying adding **frustrated** to see some hilarious gifs that I'm sure you can relate too!_
  * :dancer: Have fun! Feel expressed!

### Work-in-Progress Items

1. Allowing users to add their favorite gifs to a favorites section or page. As I start learning more about data persistence, I will try making this section persist even when the page is reloaded (via `localStorage` or `cookies`). 
  
2. Allowing users to request additional gifs to be added to the page without overwriting the existing gifs.

3. List additional metadata (title, tags, etc) for each gif in a clean and readable format.

4. Include a 1-click download button for each gif, and have this should work across device types.

5. Integrate this search with additional APIs.
